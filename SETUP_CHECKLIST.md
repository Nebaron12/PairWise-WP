## üìä Understanding Results

### Metrics Explained

**Clicks** (formerly "wins")
- Every time an image is selected
- Tracked throughout all comparisons
- Shows overall preference

**Complete Wins** (new)
- Only when an image wins the final available comparison
- More definitive measure of preference
- Best indicator of true winner

**Appearances**
- How many times image was shown
- Should be similar across all images
- Used to calculate click rate

**Click Rate**
- Percentage: (Clicks / Appearances) √ó 100
- Shows consistency of preference
- Color-coded in admin dashboard

## üéØ Best Practices

### Session Naming
‚úÖ Good:
- `camera-test-oct-2025`
- `product-comparison-v1`
- `design-ab-test-homepage`

‚ùå Avoid:
- `test` (too generic)
- `abc123` (not descriptive)
- Spaces or special characters

### Image Selection
- Use high-quality images
- Keep file sizes reasonable (<500KB)
- Use similar dimensions for fair comparison
- Host on reliable CDN or WordPress media library

### Sample Size
- **Minimum**: 30 users for reliable results
- **Good**: 50-100 users
- **Excellent**: 100+ users
- More users = more statistical confidence

### Test Duration
- Run for at least 1-2 weeks
- Consider day-of-week variations
- Account for different time zones
- Don't make decisions too quickly

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: "Could not save to database"**
- Check plugin is activated
- Verify REST API is enabled
- Check browser console for errors
- Fallback: CSV will download automatically

**Issue: No data in admin dashboard**
- Verify session name matches exactly
- Check users completed the full test
- Look in Raw Data tab for partial data
- Check WordPress error logs

**Issue: Images not loading**
- Verify image URLs are correct
- Check images are publicly accessible
- Test URLs directly in browser
- Check for HTTPS/HTTP mixed content

**Issue: Multiple users have same ID**
- Each browser generates unique ID
- Private browsing creates new ID
- Clearing localStorage resets ID
- This is normal behavior

## üìà Analyzing Results

### Quick Analysis Steps

1. **Go to Overall Results tab**
   - Look at Complete Wins column
   - Check Click Rate percentages
   - Note any outliers

2. **Review Per User Results**
   - Check for consistency
   - Identify any unusual patterns
   - Verify diverse opinions

3. **Export CSV for Deep Analysis**
   - Open in Excel/Google Sheets
   - Create pivot tables
   - Calculate statistics
   - Generate visualizations

### Statistical Considerations

**Confidence Levels:**
- 30-50 users: Basic trends
- 50-100 users: Good confidence
- 100+ users: High confidence
- 500+ users: Very high confidence

**Margin of Error:**
- Small samples = larger margin
- Calculate using online calculators
- Consider statistical significance
- Don't over-interpret small differences

## üîí Security Notes

- REST API endpoint is public (necessary for frontend)
- All inputs are sanitized
- SQL injection protection via prepared statements
- Admin dashboard requires WordPress admin privileges
- Consider rate limiting for high-traffic sites

## üìû Support

### Getting Help

1. Check the README.md
